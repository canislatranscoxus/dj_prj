# Geolocation in Django Python

This small project has small examples of Geolocation scenarios or recipes.
The idea is use them as a reference for learning purposes.
Some tools we use are, leaflet, python, django, geodjango, and geojson.

In the folder examples you can find html files, that you can open in your browser.
Those are pages can "run" as stand alone in any browser.
Those examples use html, Leaflet, and java script, they do not use python nor django,
just your browser and internet to get the map data.


run Django Project and open browser in this url
